Types of charts that I would be interested in:

1) Scatter plots for the sensitivity analysis - need data in order to perform the urban analysis 
2) Line plots with the mean/std of the epoch diffs
3) Line plots of the counterfeit ratios and double spend ratios. Play with the stopping step?

Good for now, change later.
